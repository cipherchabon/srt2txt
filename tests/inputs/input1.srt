1
00:00:08,318 --> 00:00:09,236
Ooh! Careful, Homer!

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,740
There's no time. We're late.

3
00:00:12,117 --> 00:00:14,411
O little town of Bethlehem

4
00:00:14,411 --> 00:00:15,746
O little town of Bethlehem

5
00:00:15,788 --> 00:00:20,502
How still we see the elie

6
00:00:20,627 --> 00:00:23,297
-Excuse me. Pardon me.

7
00:00:23,422 --> 00:00:25,299
- Sorry. Excuse me.
- Hey, Norman, how's it goin'?

8
00:00:25,424 --> 00:00:27,301
So you got dragged down here
too, huh?

9
00:00:27,426 --> 00:00:29,304
- How you doin', Fred?
- Sorry. Excuse me.

10
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,306
- Yeah. 'Scuse me. Oh!

11
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:34,602
Pardon my galoshes.

12
00:00:34,602 --> 00:00:39,232
Are met in thee tonight

13
00:00:41,443 --> 00:00:43,821
Wasn't that wonderful?

14
00:00:43,821 --> 00:00:47,992
And now
"Santas of many lands,"

15
00:00:48,118 --> 00:00:51,621
as presented by the entire
second grade class.

16
00:00:51,746 --> 00:00:54,250
Oh! Lisa's class.

17
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:56,627
Frohliche Weihnachten.

18
00:00:56,752 --> 00:00:59,256
That's German for
" Merry Christmas."

19
00:00:59,256 --> 00:01:04,761
In Germany, Santa's servant Ruprecht
gives presents to good children...

20
00:01:04,846 --> 00:01:08,015
and whipping rods
to the parents of bad ones.

21
00:01:11,478 --> 00:01:13,313
Merry Kurisumasu.

22
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,778
I am Hotseiosha, a japanese priest
who acts like Santa Claus.

23
00:01:18,862 --> 00:01:21,364
I have eyes
in the back ofmy head...

24
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:24,744
so children better behave
when I'm nearby.

25
00:01:26,871 --> 00:01:30,041
Now presenting Lisa Simpson...

26
00:01:30,167 --> 00:01:35,465
as Tawanga, the Santa Claus
of the South Seas.

27
00:01:35,548 --> 00:01:37,467
Ooh, it's Lisa! That's ours.

28
00:01:51,566 --> 00:01:55,780
Ah, the fourth grade
will now favor us with a melody--

29
00:01:55,863 --> 00:01:59,450
Uh, medley
of holiday "flavorites."

30
00:01:59,575 --> 00:02:02,079
Dashing through the snow

31
00:02:02,162 --> 00:02:04,581
In a one-horse open sleigh

32
00:02:04,664 --> 00:02:06,584
O'er the fields we go

33
00:02:06,667 --> 00:02:08,753
Laughing all the way
Ha ha ha

34
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,963
Bells on bobtail ring

35
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:14,259
- Isn't Bart sweet, Homer?

36
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:17,554
He sings like an angel.

37
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:21,059
Oh, jingle bells
Batman smells

38
00:02:21,184 --> 00:02:23,061
Robin laid an egg

39
00:02:23,186 --> 00:02:25,272
The Batmobile
broke its wheel

40
00:02:25,356 --> 00:02:27,566
The joker got awa--

41
00:02:27,566 --> 00:02:29,777
Jingle bells
Jingle bells

42
00:02:02,346 --> 00:02:03,879
Jingle all

43
00:02:03,946 --> 00:02:05,713
The fifth grade will now favour us...

44
00:02:34,074 --> 00:02:39,163
with a scene from Charles, uh, Dickens'
A Christmas Carol.

45
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:43,836
How many grades does this school have?

46
00:02:43,877 --> 00:02:47,506
" Dear friends of the Simpson family,

47
00:02:47,589 --> 00:02:50,760
"We had some sadness and
some gladness this year.

48
00:02:50,885 --> 00:02:53,263
" First, the sadness.
Our little cat Snowball...

49
00:02:53,388 --> 00:02:56,517
"was unexpectedly run over
and went to kitty heaven.

50
00:02:56,559 --> 00:02:59,186
"But we bought
a new little cat, Snowball I.

51
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:02,023
"So I guess life goes on.

52
00:03:02,065 --> 00:03:06,820
"Speaking of life going on,
Grandpa's still with us, feisty as ever.

53
00:03:06,862 --> 00:03:08,823
" Maggie is walking by herself,

54
00:03:08,865 --> 00:03:12,535
"Lisa got straight A's,
and Bart--

55
00:03:12,577 --> 00:03:15,038
"Well, we love Bart.

56
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,041
"The magic of the season
has touched us all.

57
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,336
Marge, haven't you finished
that stupid letter yet?

58
00:03:20,336 --> 00:03:23,590
- " Homer sends his love. Happy holidays.
- Marge!

59
00:03:23,715 --> 00:03:26,010
- The Simpsons."
- Marge, where's the extension cord?

60
00:03:26,093 --> 00:03:28,888
For heaven's sake, Homer.
It's in the utility drawer.

61
00:03:29,013 --> 00:03:31,390
Sorry. I'm just a big kid.

62
00:03:31,515 --> 00:03:33,769
And I love Christmas
so much.

63
00:03:34,895 --> 00:03:37,898
D'oh!

64
00:03:38,024 --> 00:03:40,067
All right, children,
let me have those letters.

65
00:03:40,234 --> 00:03:43,029
I'll send them to Santa's workshop
at the North Pole.

66
00:03:43,029 --> 00:03:45,073
Oh, please. There's only
one fat guy that brings us presents,

67
00:03:45,073 --> 00:03:47,075
and his name ain't Santa.

68
00:03:47,075 --> 00:03:50,413
Uh-- A pony?

69
00:03:50,538 --> 00:03:54,083
Oh, Lisa, you've asked for that
for the last three years,

70
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:57,713
and I keep telling you Santa can't
fit a pony into his sleigh.

71
00:03:57,838 --> 00:03:59,715
Can't you take a hint?

72
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,717
But I really want a pony,

73
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:05,013
- and I've been really good this year.
- Oh, dear.

74
00:04:05,138 --> 00:04:07,849
Maybe Bart is
a little more realistic.

75
00:04:07,933 --> 00:04:09,811
- A tattoo?
- A what?

76
00:04:09,936 --> 00:04:12,230
Yeah! They're cool, and they last
the rest of your life.

77
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:15,025
you will not be getting
a tattoo for Christmas.

78
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:18,320
Yeah. If you want one, you'll have
to pay for it out of your allowance.

79
00:04:18,445 --> 00:04:19,822
- All right!
- Homer!

80
00:04:19,822 --> 00:04:21,825
- "Yello."

81
00:04:21,825 --> 00:04:23,827
- Marge, please.
- Who's this?

82
00:04:23,952 --> 00:04:25,829
May I please speak to Marge?

83
00:04:25,912 --> 00:04:28,749
- This is her sister, isn't it?
- Is Marge there?

84
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:32,253
- Who shall I say is calling?
- Marge, please.

85
00:04:32,253 --> 00:04:35,549
It's your sister.
Oh!

86
00:04:35,632 --> 00:04:38,135
- Hello.
- Hello, Marge. It's Patty.

87
00:04:38,218 --> 00:04:42,723
Selma and I couldn't be more excited
about seeing our sister Christmas Eve.

88
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:46,854
Well, Homer and I are looking
forward to your visit too.

89
00:04:48,856 --> 00:04:51,316
Somehow I doubt
that Homer is excited.

90
00:04:51,443 --> 00:04:53,319
of all the men
you could've married,

91
00:04:53,445 --> 00:04:56,322
I don't know why you picked
one who's always so rude to us.

92
00:04:56,448 --> 00:04:58,742
- Good one, Dad.

93
00:04:58,826 --> 00:05:01,537
Okay, kids,
prepare to be dazzled.

94
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,332
Marge, turn on the juice!

95
00:05:06,835 --> 00:05:09,254
- What do you think, kids?

96
00:05:09,337 --> 00:05:11,257
- Nice try, Dad.

97
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,551
Just hold
your horses, son. Hey, Simpson!

98
00:05:13,634 --> 00:05:17,431
- What is it, Flanders?
- Do you think this looks okay?

99
00:05:17,431 --> 00:05:21,226
Ho ho ho. Ho ho ho.

100
00:05:21,351 --> 00:05:22,729
- Oh!
- Oh, neato!

101
00:05:22,854 --> 00:05:25,273
It's too bright.

102
00:05:25,356 --> 00:05:27,650
I oughta-- Flanders.
What a big show-off.

103
00:05:30,946 --> 00:05:33,282
- Kids, wanna go Christmas shopping?
- I do!

104
00:05:33,324 --> 00:05:35,827
- All right! The mall!
- Go get your money.

105
00:05:35,952 --> 00:05:39,164
Tell us, Marge. Where have
you been hiding the Christmas money?

106
00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:41,959
Oh, I have my secrets.

107
00:05:42,084 --> 00:05:44,086
Turn around.

108
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:50,636
- you can look now.
- Ooh! Big jar this year.

109
00:06:10,283 --> 00:06:12,286
Oh, Bart,
that's so sweet.

110
00:06:12,286 --> 00:06:14,789
It's the best present
a mother could get,

111
00:06:14,872 --> 00:06:17,334
and it makes you look
so dangerous.

112
00:06:20,045 --> 00:06:22,172
- One " Mother," please.

113
00:06:22,297 --> 00:06:24,175
Wait a minute.
How old are you?

114
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,302
- Twenty-one, sir.
- Get in the chair.

115
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:34,478
Mm-hmm.

116
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:37,482
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

117
00:06:37,607 --> 00:06:40,485
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

118
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,197
Attention,
all personnel, please keep working...

119
00:06:43,281 --> 00:06:45,199
during the following
announcement.

120
00:06:45,283 --> 00:06:48,787
And now our boss and friend
Mr. Burns.

121
00:06:48,912 --> 00:06:51,206
Hello. I'm proud to announce...

122
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:54,210
that we've been able to increase
safety here at the plant...

123
00:06:54,294 --> 00:06:56,504
without increasing the cost
to the consumer...

124
00:06:56,588 --> 00:06:58,798
or affecting management
payraises.

125
00:06:58,798 --> 00:07:01,886
However, for you
semiskilled workers,

126
00:07:01,886 --> 00:07:03,888
there will be
no Christmas bonuses.

127
00:07:03,888 --> 00:07:07,517
- Oh, and one more thing.

128
00:07:07,601 --> 00:07:09,519
Merry Christmas!

129
00:07:09,603 --> 00:07:13,107
- Oh, thank God for the big jar.

130
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:18,404
- Where's that Bart?

131
00:07:24,495 --> 00:07:28,500
But, Mom,
I thought you'd like it.

132
00:07:30,293 --> 00:07:33,088
Yes, Mrs. Simpson, we can remove
your son's tattoo.

133
00:07:33,214 --> 00:07:35,591
It's a simple routine
involving lasers.

134
00:07:35,716 --> 00:07:38,011
- Cool!
- However, it is rather expensive,

135
00:07:38,011 --> 00:07:40,806
and we must insist
on a cash payment up front.

136
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:43,017
- Cash?
- Mm-hmm.

137
00:07:43,017 --> 00:07:46,020
Thank God for
Homer's Christmas bonus.

138
00:07:47,814 --> 00:07:51,401
- Ay, caramba!
- Now, whatever you do, don't squirm.

139
00:07:51,527 --> 00:07:55,532
you don't wanna get this sucker
near your eye or your groin.

140
00:07:57,617 --> 00:08:01,204
- Ow! Quit it.

141
00:08:01,372 --> 00:08:03,207
Ow! Quit it.

142
00:08:03,332 --> 00:08:05,209
Ow! Quit it.

143
00:08:05,292 --> 00:08:07,712
- Ow! Quit it.
- Hey, what's with this?

144
00:08:07,712 --> 00:08:11,508
Ow! Quit it!
Used to be a real boss tattoo.

145
00:08:11,675 --> 00:08:14,929
Mom had to spend the Christmas money
having it surgically removed.

146
00:08:15,054 --> 00:08:17,723
Huh?

147
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:21,854
It's true!

148
00:08:21,895 --> 00:08:25,607
The jar is empty!
Oh, my God!

149
00:08:25,607 --> 00:08:28,069
We're ruined.
Christmas is canceled.

150
00:08:28,111 --> 00:08:30,238
No presents for anyone!

151
00:08:30,363 --> 00:08:34,076
Don't worry, Homer. We'll just
have to stretch your Christmas bonus...

152
00:08:34,076 --> 00:08:36,412
- even further this year.

153
00:08:36,412 --> 00:08:39,624
- Homer?
- Oh, yeah. My Christmas bonus.

154
00:08:39,749 --> 00:08:42,419
How silly of me.

155
00:08:42,544 --> 00:08:45,548
This'll be the best
Christmas yet.

156
00:08:45,548 --> 00:08:47,550
The best any family
ever had.

157
00:08:51,263 --> 00:08:53,265
Hohoho.

158
00:08:54,308 --> 00:08:56,436
Hohoho.

159
00:08:57,604 --> 00:09:00,273
Hohoho.

160
00:09:01,566 --> 00:09:04,778
Ho ho ho.

161
00:09:04,862 --> 00:09:06,780
Hohoho.

162
00:09:09,576 --> 00:09:13,079
Hmm. I get the feeling there's
something you haven't told me, Homer.

163
00:09:13,121 --> 00:09:16,876
- Huh? Oh. I love you, Marge.
- you tell me that all the time.

164
00:09:16,876 --> 00:09:19,086
Oh, good,
because I do love you.

165
00:09:19,128 --> 00:09:22,257
I don't deserve you as much
as a guy with a fat wallet...

166
00:09:22,257 --> 00:09:25,135
and a credit card that won't
set off that horrible beeping.

167
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,473
I think it does have something
to do with your Christmas bonus.

168
00:09:28,556 --> 00:09:30,475
I keep asking for it,
but--

169
00:09:30,558 --> 00:09:34,063
Marge, um,
let me be honest with you.

170
00:09:34,146 --> 00:09:38,317
- Yes?
- Well, I would--

171
00:09:42,072 --> 00:09:44,783
I-- I wanna do
the Christmas shopping this year.

172
00:09:44,783 --> 00:09:47,453
Uh, sure, okay.

173
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,586
Marge, Marge. Hmm. Let'ssee.

174
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,880
Ooh, look!

175
00:09:56,964 --> 00:10:00,385
Pantyhose.
Practical and alluring.

176
00:10:00,468 --> 00:10:03,763
A six-pack.
Oh! Only 4.99.

177
00:10:03,763 --> 00:10:05,975
Ooh! Pads of paper.

178
00:10:06,058 --> 00:10:09,270
I bet Bart can think of
a million things to do with these.

179
00:10:09,395 --> 00:10:12,774
That just leaves
little Maggie. Oh, look!

180
00:10:12,858 --> 00:10:14,860
A little squeak toy.

181
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,864
It says it's for dogs,
but she can't read.

182
00:10:18,865 --> 00:10:21,993
Ow! Oh, Simpson,
it's you.

183
00:10:22,076 --> 00:10:25,664
- Hello, Flanders.
- Oh, my! What a mess we've got here.

184
00:10:25,789 --> 00:10:28,167
Well, which ones are yours
and which ones are mine?

185
00:10:28,167 --> 00:10:31,462
- Well, let's see.
- Oh, this one's mine. This one's mine.

186
00:10:31,588 --> 00:10:34,090
- This one's mine, and this--
- They're all yours!

187
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:37,261
- Hey, you dropped your pork chop.

188
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:40,974
- Gimme that!
- Well, happy holidays, Simpson.

189
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:45,604
- Gee, this is the best Christmas ever.
- You bet.

190
00:10:55,115 --> 00:10:59,204
What's the matter, Homer? Somebody
leave a lump of coal in your stocking?

191
00:10:59,287 --> 00:11:01,497
You've been sitting there,
sucking on a beer all day long.

192
00:11:01,623 --> 00:11:03,875
- So?
- So, it's Christmas.

193
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,671
- Thanks, Moe.

194
00:11:07,838 --> 00:11:09,673
Drinks all around!

195
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,676
What's with
the crazy getup, Barn?

196
00:11:11,843 --> 00:11:16,348
I got me a part-timejob
working as a Santa down at the mall.

197
00:11:16,348 --> 00:11:18,309
Wow! Can I do that?

198
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:21,187
I don't know. They're
pretty selective.

199
00:11:21,312 --> 00:11:23,189
Do you like children?

200
00:11:23,314 --> 00:11:26,610
What do you mean? All the time?
Even when they're nuts?

201
00:11:26,693 --> 00:11:30,198
- Hmm.
- Uh, I certainly do.

202
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:32,200
Welcome aboard, Simpson.

203
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:34,953
Pending your successful completion
of our training program, that is.

204
00:11:34,953 --> 00:11:38,207
Ho ho ho. Ho ho ho.

205
00:11:38,332 --> 00:11:41,210
Ho ho ho. Ho ho ho.

206
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:44,381
- What is it now, Simpson?
- Uh, when do we get paid?

207
00:11:44,548 --> 00:11:48,052
Not a dime till Christmas Eve!
Now, from the top.

208
00:11:48,135 --> 00:11:52,014
Ho ho ho. Ho ho ho.

209
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:55,018
Um, Dasher.

210
00:11:55,143 --> 00:11:57,729
- Dancer.
- Mm-hmm.

211
00:11:57,729 --> 00:11:59,898
- Prancer.
- Mm-hmm.

212
00:12:00,023 --> 00:12:01,901
Nixon.

213
00:12:02,026 --> 00:12:05,321
Comet and... Cupid.

214
00:12:05,405 --> 00:12:07,324
- Donna Dixon?
- Sit down, Simpson.

215
00:12:07,408 --> 00:12:09,326
And what would you like,
little boy?

216
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:11,829
- You're not really Santa, tubby.
- Why, you little egghead!

217
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:14,541
No, Homer! If such
an emergency arises,

218
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:17,419
you just tell them
Santa's vey busy this time of year,

219
00:12:17,419 --> 00:12:21,132
- and you are one of his helpers.
- Oh, I knew that one too!

220
00:12:24,135 --> 00:12:26,638
Homer, why are you
seven hours late?

221
00:12:26,722 --> 00:12:29,641
Not a word, Marge.
I'm heading straight for the tub.

222
00:12:29,641 --> 00:12:31,644
But, Homer,
my sisters are here.

223
00:12:31,644 --> 00:12:33,855
- Don't you wanna say hello?

224
00:12:36,232 --> 00:12:39,028
- Daddy! We're so glad to see you!
- Oh, Dad, you're finally home!

225
00:12:39,153 --> 00:12:42,531
What? Why?
Oh, yeah.

226
00:12:42,656 --> 00:12:45,243
Hello, Patty.
Hello, Selma.

227
00:12:45,327 --> 00:12:47,662
- How was your trip?
- Fine.

228
00:12:47,746 --> 00:12:49,957
- you both look well.
- Thank you.

229
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:53,252
- Yeah, well, Merry Christmas.
- It's Christmas?

230
00:12:53,252 --> 00:12:56,131
- you wouldn't know it around here.
- And why is that?

231
00:12:56,256 --> 00:13:00,260
- For one thing, there's no tree
- I was just on my way out to get one!

232
00:13:00,344 --> 00:13:02,055
- Can we go too, Dad?
- Yeah, can we?

233
00:13:02,138 --> 00:13:03,348
No!

234
00:13:03,431 --> 00:13:06,059
Sleighbells ring

235
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:08,687
Are you listening

236
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:11,440
In the lane

237
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,069
Snow is glistening

238
00:13:14,069 --> 00:13:17,447
A beautiful sight

239
00:13:17,447 --> 00:13:20,451
We're happy tonight

240
00:13:20,451 --> 00:13:24,038
- Walking in a winter wonderland

241
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:28,961
Hey! What do you think you're doin'?

242
00:13:29,044 --> 00:13:30,963
- Uh-oh.
- Hey! Hey!

243
00:13:31,046 --> 00:13:33,132
- Come back here!

244
00:13:35,885 --> 00:13:39,139
So what do you think, kids?
Beauty, isn't it?

245
00:13:39,139 --> 00:13:42,101
- Wow! Yay, Dad!
- Way to go, Dad!

246
00:13:42,142 --> 00:13:45,939
- Why is there a birdhouse in it?
- Uh, that's an ornament.

247
00:13:46,064 --> 00:13:48,400
Do I smell gunpowder?

248
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:51,237
and then I want some Robotoids.

249
00:13:51,404 --> 00:13:53,447
And then I want
a Goop Monster.

250
00:13:53,573 --> 00:13:55,449
And then I want
a great big, giant--

251
00:13:55,575 --> 00:13:57,452
Aw, son, you don't need
all that junk.

252
00:13:57,619 --> 00:14:00,706
I'm sure you've already
got something much more important--

253
00:14:00,789 --> 00:14:05,295
a decent home and a loving father
who would do anything for you.

254
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,089
Hey, I couldn't afford lunch.
Give me a bite of that donut.

255
00:14:10,968 --> 00:14:12,970
Get a load of that
quote-unquote Santa.

256
00:14:13,095 --> 00:14:15,307
I can't believe those kids
are falling for it.

257
00:14:15,307 --> 00:14:17,475
Hey, Milhouse, I dare you
to sit on his lap.

258
00:14:17,601 --> 00:14:22,106
- I dare you to yank his beard off.
- Ah, touche.

259
00:14:22,148 --> 00:14:24,108
I hope you feel better,
Santa.

260
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,652
Oh, I will when Mrs. Claus' sisters
get outta town.

261
00:14:26,652 --> 00:14:28,655
Thanks for listenin', kid.

262
00:14:30,824 --> 00:14:32,659
Hey, Santa,
what's shakin', man?

263
00:14:32,784 --> 00:14:36,497
What's your name, Bart... ner?
Uh, little partner?

264
00:14:36,623 --> 00:14:39,793
- I'm Bart Simpson. Who are you?
- I'm jolly Old St. Nick.

265
00:14:39,793 --> 00:14:42,296
Oh, yeah?
We'll just see about that.

266
00:14:42,421 --> 00:14:45,007
D'oh!

267
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:48,887
- Homer!
- A word with you in Santa's workshop.

268
00:14:49,012 --> 00:14:52,308
- Cover for me, Elfie.
- I didn't know it was you.

269
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,393
Nobody knows.
It's a secret.

270
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,395
I didn't get my bonus this year.

271
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,690
But to keep the family
from missing out on Christmas,

272
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,609
- I'd do anything.
- I'll say, Dad.

273
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:03,904
you must really love us
to sink so low.

274
00:15:05,323 --> 00:15:07,200
Now, let's not get mushy, son.

275
00:15:07,325 --> 00:15:09,327
I still have a job to do.

276
00:15:09,327 --> 00:15:11,330
Hey, little ones. Santa's back.

277
00:15:11,413 --> 00:15:13,415
Ho ho-- D'oh!

278
00:15:13,499 --> 00:15:16,294
Damn it to--

279
00:15:16,419 --> 00:15:18,630
Ah, son, one day
you're gonna know...

280
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,632
the satisfaction of payday.

281
00:15:20,632 --> 00:15:24,011
Receiving a big fat check
for a job well done.

282
00:15:24,095 --> 00:15:26,013
Simpson, Homer?
Here ya go.

283
00:15:26,097 --> 00:15:30,602
Come on, son. Let's go cash
this baby and get presents for--

284
00:15:30,602 --> 00:15:33,522
Thirteen bucks? Hey, wait a minute.

285
00:15:33,605 --> 00:15:35,525
That's right.
$120 gross.

286
00:15:35,608 --> 00:15:37,527
Less Social Security,
less unemployment insurance,

287
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:39,612
- less Santa training...
- Santa training?

288
00:15:39,612 --> 00:15:41,615
less costume purchase,
less beard rental, less Christmas club.

289
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:43,826
- But-- But--
- See ya next year.

290
00:15:43,951 --> 00:15:47,038
- Ohh!
- Come on, Dad. Let's go home.

291
00:15:47,038 --> 00:15:48,999
Thirteen bucks?

292
00:15:48,999 --> 00:15:51,334
you can't get anything
for 13 bucks.

293
00:15:51,459 --> 00:15:54,463
Allright!
Thirteen bigones!

294
00:15:54,505 --> 00:15:56,632
Springfield Downs,
here I come!

295
00:15:56,632 --> 00:15:58,968
- What?
- you heard me.

296
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:00,971
I'm goin' to the dog track.

297
00:16:01,013 --> 00:16:03,015
I got a hot little puppy
in the fourth race.

298
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:05,142
- Wanna come?
- Sory, Barney.

299
00:16:05,142 --> 00:16:08,479
I may be a total washout as a father,
but I'm not gonna take my kid...

300
00:16:08,521 --> 00:16:10,815
to a sleazy dog track
on Christmas Eve.

301
00:16:10,982 --> 00:16:14,653
Come on, Simpson.
The dog's name is Whirlwind.

302
00:16:14,737 --> 00:16:17,156
Ten-to-one shot.
Money in the bank.

303
00:16:17,156 --> 00:16:19,159
- Uh-uh.
- Ah, come on, Dad.

304
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:22,037
This can be the miracle that
saves the Simpsons' Christmas.

305
00:16:22,162 --> 00:16:24,040
If TV has taught me anything,

306
00:16:24,165 --> 00:16:27,168
it's that miracles always
happen to poor kids at Christmas.

307
00:16:27,209 --> 00:16:30,964
It happened to Tiny Tim,
it happened to Charlie Brown,

308
00:16:31,006 --> 00:16:33,008
it happened to the Smurfs
and it's gonna happen to us.

309
00:16:34,676 --> 00:16:38,181
Well, okay, let's go.
Who's Tiny Tim?

310
00:16:39,724 --> 00:16:41,726
Hey, Moldy, do you
think Santa will be able to find...

311
00:16:41,726 --> 00:16:44,188
ElfCounty
under all this snow?

312
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:48,985
I doubt it, Bubbles. We'll be
sad little elves this Christmas.

313
00:16:49,069 --> 00:16:50,987
- Oh, no!
- Oh, brother.

314
00:16:51,071 --> 00:16:53,073
- Where's your husband?
- Yeah. It's getting late.

315
00:16:53,156 --> 00:16:55,743
Said he went caroling
with Bart.

316
00:16:55,868 --> 00:16:59,747
We're in the money,
we're in the money

317
00:16:59,747 --> 00:17:03,085
We got a lot of
what it takes to get along

318
00:17:03,168 --> 00:17:05,254
I can't believe
I'm doing this.

319
00:17:05,379 --> 00:17:08,383
Can we open
our presents now, Dad?

320
00:17:08,424 --> 00:17:11,427
you know the tradition, son.
Not till the eighth race.

321
00:17:11,552 --> 00:17:13,764
Hey, Barney,
which one is Whirlwind?

322
00:17:13,889 --> 00:17:17,768
Number Six. That's our lucky dog
right over there.

323
00:17:17,893 --> 00:17:20,355
He's won
his last five races.

324
00:17:20,355 --> 00:17:22,857
What? That scrawny little
bag of bones?

325
00:17:22,983 --> 00:17:25,570
Come on, Dad. They're all
scrawny little bags of bones.

326
00:17:25,695 --> 00:17:28,072
Yeah, you're right.

327
00:17:28,197 --> 00:17:31,493
I guess Whirlwind is our only hope
for a Merry Christmas.

328
00:17:31,577 --> 00:17:33,870
Attention,
racing fans, we have a late scratch...

329
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:35,872
in the fourth race.

330
00:17:35,872 --> 00:17:38,960
Number 8, Sir Galahad will be
replaced by Santa's Little Helper.

331
00:17:39,085 --> 00:17:43,089
Once again, Sir Galahad has been
replaced by Santa's Little Helper.

332
00:17:43,172 --> 00:17:45,175
Bart, did you hear that?

333
00:17:45,175 --> 00:17:47,177
What a name!
Santa's Little Helper!

334
00:17:47,261 --> 00:17:51,099
- It's a sign! It's an omen!
- It's a coincidence, Dad.

335
00:17:51,099 --> 00:17:54,185
- What are the odds on Santa's Little
Helper? - Ninety-nine to one.

336
00:17:54,269 --> 00:17:59,900
Wow! Ninety-nine times
thirteen equals... Merry Christmas!

337
00:17:59,984 --> 00:18:01,904
I got a bad feeling
about this.

338
00:18:01,987 --> 00:18:03,864
- Don't you believe in me, son?
- Uh--

339
00:18:04,031 --> 00:18:07,034
Come on, boy. Sometimes your faith
is all that keeps me going.

340
00:18:09,537 --> 00:18:12,040
Oh, go for it, Dad.

341
00:18:12,081 --> 00:18:15,878
That's my boy! Eveything on
Santa's Little Helper.

342
00:18:15,878 --> 00:18:18,297
Three cheers for Brainy!

343
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,884
- Hip hip hooray!
- Yay!

344
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:22,886
Unadulterated pap.

345
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:25,472
It's almost 9:00.
Where's Homer anyway?

346
00:18:25,472 --> 00:18:28,476
It's so typical
of the big doof us to spoil it all.

347
00:18:28,476 --> 00:18:30,770
- What, Aunt Patty?
- Oh, nothing, dear.

348
00:18:30,895 --> 00:18:32,898
I'm just trashing
your father.

349
00:18:32,898 --> 00:18:34,900
Well, I wish you wouldn't...

350
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:39,280
because aside from the fact he has
the same frailties as all human belings.

351
00:18:39,405 --> 00:18:41,282
he's the only father I have.

352
00:18:41,407 --> 00:18:44,077
Therefore, he is
my model of manhood,

353
00:18:44,244 --> 00:18:48,582
and my estimation of him will govern
the prospects of my adult relationships.

354
00:18:48,749 --> 00:18:52,420
So I hope you bear in mind that
any knock at him is a knock at me,

355
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:56,801
and I'm far too young to defend
myself against such onslaughts.

356
00:18:57,927 --> 00:19:01,097
Mm-hmm. Go watch
your cartoon show, dear.

357
00:19:01,097 --> 00:19:03,100
Come on, Bart.

358
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,936
Kiss the ticket for good luck,
not that we need it.

359
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:11,609
Here comes
Screwy the mechanical rabbit.

360
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,236
- and they're off!

361
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:16,490
- Come on, Santa's Little Helper!
- Come on, dog! Go, man, go!

362
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,743
It's Whirlwind in the lane, and
coming up on the left is Quadruped,

363
00:19:19,785 --> 00:19:21,955
followed by Dog O'War
and Fido.

364
00:19:21,997 --> 00:19:25,000
- Go! Come on, boy!
- Go! Come on, get that rabbit!

365
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:27,628
Dog O'War coming up fast
on the outside.

366
00:19:27,753 --> 00:19:29,755
- Come on, Santa's Little Helper!
- Come on, dog! Go, man, go!

367
00:19:29,797 --> 00:19:33,009
And with a lock on last place,
it's Santa's Little Helper.

368
00:19:33,134 --> 00:19:36,847
- Don't worry, Dad.

369
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:40,143
Maybe this is just for suspense
before the miracle happens.

370
00:19:40,184 --> 00:19:43,646
- Come on, you stupid dog! Come on!
- Go, go!

371
00:19:43,688 --> 00:19:45,941
- Run! Run!
- Run, run! Come on, get that rabbit!

372
00:19:46,025 --> 00:19:48,736
- Go, go, Santa's Little Helper! Run!
- Go, go, go!

373
00:19:48,861 --> 00:19:53,033
Whirlwind by a countrymile, second,
ChewMyShoe, followed by Dog O'War.

374
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:55,535
Oh, jeez!

375
00:19:55,535 --> 00:19:58,956
Doesn't seem possible,
but I guess TV has betrayed me.

376
00:19:58,956 --> 00:20:01,542
I don't wanna leave
till our dog finishes.

377
00:20:06,757 --> 00:20:08,634
Ah, forget it.
Let's go.

378
00:20:17,853 --> 00:20:20,564
- Find any winners, son?
- Sory, Dad.

379
00:20:20,648 --> 00:20:23,652
Hey, hey, Simpson!
What'dl tell you?

380
00:20:23,652 --> 00:20:26,947
Whirlwind!
Let's go, Daria.

381
00:20:31,661 --> 00:20:34,831
Beat it! Scram! Get lost!

382
00:20:34,957 --> 00:20:37,668
- you came in last for the last time!

383
00:20:37,751 --> 00:20:40,045
Look, Dad, it's
Santa's Little Helper.

384
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:43,049
And don't come back!

385
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:45,635
Oh, no, you don't! No, no!
Get away from me! Uh-uh!

386
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:51,433
Oh, can we keep him,
Dad, please?

387
00:20:51,558 --> 00:20:54,854
But he's a loser!
He's pathetic! He's--

388
00:20:56,982 --> 00:20:58,984
A Simpson.

389
00:21:02,071 --> 00:21:04,657
Hmm. Maybe I should
call the police.

390
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,995
- Oh, he'll sober up.
- Yeah. Come staggering home.

391
00:21:07,995 --> 00:21:10,247
Mm-hmm.
Smelling of cheap perfume.

392
00:21:10,247 --> 00:21:12,500
- Homer!

393
00:21:12,542 --> 00:21:15,169
- What? What the-- Who the--
- Look, eveybody,

394
00:21:15,253 --> 00:21:18,841
- I have a confession to make.
- This should be good.

395
00:21:19,008 --> 00:21:21,343
I didn't get
my Christmas bonus.

396
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:24,180
I tried not to let it
ruin Christmas for eveybody,

397
00:21:24,306 --> 00:21:26,182
but no matter
what I did--

398
00:21:26,308 --> 00:21:29,812
- Hey, eveybody, lookwhat we got!

399
00:21:29,812 --> 00:21:32,690
A dog!
All right, Dad!

400
00:21:32,815 --> 00:21:36,695
- God bless him.
- So love at first sight is possible.

401
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:39,364
And if he runs away,
he'll be easy to catch.

402
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:41,575
Oh,
this is the best gift of all, Homer!

403
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,370
- It is? -
Yes. Something to share our love...

404
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,372
and frighten prowlers.

405
00:21:46,372 --> 00:21:48,709
- What's his name?
- Number 8--

406
00:21:48,709 --> 00:21:51,503
I mean, Santa's Little Helper.

407
00:22:05,061 --> 00:22:07,773
Rudolph the red-nosed
reindeer

408
00:22:07,773 --> 00:22:11,026
Had a very shiny nose

409
00:22:11,068 --> 00:22:13,905
And if you ever saw it

410
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:17,075
- you would even say it glows
- Like a light bulb!

411
00:22:17,075 --> 00:22:20,079
-Bart!
- All of the other reindeer

412
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:22,081
Used to laugh
and call him names

413
00:22:22,081 --> 00:22:24,083
- Like Shnozzola!
-Lisa!

414
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:26,419
They never let poor Rudolph

415
00:22:26,503 --> 00:22:29,297
- Join in any reindeergames
-Like strippoker!

416
00:22:29,422 --> 00:22:32,802
-I'm warning you two!
- Then one foggy Christmas Eve

417
00:22:32,927 --> 00:22:35,930
- Santa came to say
- Take it, Homer!

418
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:39,434
Uh, Rudolph get your nose over here

419
00:22:39,518 --> 00:22:43,021
- So you can guide my sleigh today
- Oh, Homer.

420
00:22:43,021 --> 00:22:45,900
Then all the reindeer
loved him

421
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:49,028
and they shouted out
with glee

422
00:22:49,112 --> 00:22:51,907
Rudolph the red-nosed
reindeer

423
00:22:52,032 --> 00:22:55,620
You'll go down in history

424
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,205
-Like Attila the Hu--
- You little--

425
00:23:00,917 --> 00:23:02,837
Shh.
